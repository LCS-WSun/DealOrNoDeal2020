// Create the array with briefcase values

// getBriefcaseOpened
//
// PURPOSE:
//
// Asks the user for a briefcase that is opened during a turn, as shown in the example.
// When the input is invalid, the prompt is repeated.
//
// INPUT / PARAMETERS:
//
// What turn it is
//
// OUTPUT / RETURN VALUE:
//
// An integer between 1 and 10, inclusive
func getBriefcaseOpened(onTurn turn: Int) -> Int {
    
    // STUDENTS: Complete this function
    
    
    // The statement below can be modified

// Loop and ask what briefcases have been opened

    // Get which briefcase was opened
    let briefcaseOpenedThisTime = getBriefcaseOpened(onTurn: turn)
    
    // STUDENTS: Now that you know what briefcase is opened... what might you do to the array value(s)?
    briefcaseValues[briefcaseOpenedThisTime - 1] = 0
    
}

// STUDENTS: Do any remaining calculations you might need below.


//Implementing my logic but not knowing the proper syntax






//if the banker's offer is less than the average of the unopened cases: NO DEAL

//if banker'sOffer <= averageOfUnopenedcases {
//print: ("NO DEAL")

//}

//if the banker's offer is more than the average of the unopened cases: DEAL

//if banker'sOffer >= averageOfUnopenedcases {
//print("DEAL")
//}

//if the banker's offer is equal to the average of the unopned cases: YOUR CHOICE

//if banker'sOffer == averageOfUnopened {
//print ("It is your choice to chose what")
//}




//Firuring out the percentage of the cases

//let closedCases =

//let openCases =

//let percentageOfCases = (closed - open) / (closed) * 100

// The user compare this value the banker's offer that he gives


//Guard statements that need to be implemented

// value 1-10
// no user input

// STUDENTS: Now tell the player whether to take the deal, or not.
